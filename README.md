## API Documentation

### BoardGameGeek API Interaction

This service utilizes the BoardGameGeek XML API2 for fetching board game data. Below is the description of the method used:

### Endpoint
- **GET** `https://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi2/thing`

### Parameters
- `id` : A unique identifier for the game. This service iterates over a range of IDs to fetch multiple games.

### Response Format
- The response is in XML format. The service parses this XML to extract relevant game data like the title, description, and image URL.

### Example of Extracted Data
- **Title**: Extracted from the primary name node in the XML.
- **Description**: Plain text, extracted and cleaned of unnecessary encoding.
- **Image URL**: Direct URL to the game's image.

### Authentication
- The BoardGameGeek API does not require authentication for this type of request.

## FAQs / Troubleshooting

### Q1: What happens if the API call fails?
**A1**: The service logs an error message with the game ID and response code. No data will be saved for that game.

### Q2: How can I change the range of game IDs fetched?
**A2**: Modify the `game_ids` array in the `import_games` method to include the IDs you wish to fetch.

### Q3: What if I can't find a specific game in the catalog?
**A3**: Presently the games catalog is heavily limited. If you wish to add a new game, make a suggestion by contacting rohan.mendiratta01@gmail.com. 

### Q4: Is there a way to connect with other players before the event?
**A4**: Yes, each game night event has the profiles of the host as well as each of the reserved guests. Visit their profiles to view their contact details. 

### Q5: How do I submit a bug or feature request?
**A5**: To submit a bug or feature request, please use the GitHub Issues section of our repository.
